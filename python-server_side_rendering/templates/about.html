            Welcome to the About Us page of My Flask App.
            This application is designed as a learning exercise to demonstrate
            the core concepts of web development using the Flask framework and Jinja2 templating engine.

            We focus on creating simple, yet effective, web pages with reusable components
            to ensure consistency and maintainability across the site.
